NAME
    Acme::Lingua::ZH::Remix - The Chinese sentence generator.

SYNOPSIS
        use Acme::Lingua::ZH::Remix;

        my $x = Acme::Lingua::ZH::Remix->new;

        # Generate a random sentance
        say $x->random_sentence;

DESCRIPTION
    Because lipsum is not funny enough, that is the reason to write this
    module.

    This module is a Moo-based, with "new" method being the constructor.

    The "random_sentence" method returns a string of one sentence of Chinese
    like:

        真是完全失敗，孩子！怎麼不動了呢？

    By default, it uses small corpus data from Project Gutenberg. The
    generated sentences are remixes of the corpus.

    You can feed you own corpus data to the `feed` method:

        my $x = Acme::Lingua::ZH::Remix->new;
        $x->feed($my_corpus);

        # Say something based on $my_corpus
        say $x->random_santence;

    The corpus should use full-width punctuation characters.

METHODS
  split_corpus($corpus_text)
    Takes a scalar, returns an list.

    This is an utility method that does not change the internal state of the
    topic object.

  feed($corpus_text)
    Instance method. Takes a scalar, return the topic object.

    Merge $corpus_text into the internal phrases corpus of the object.

  random_sentence( min => $min, max => $max )
    Instance method. Optionally takes "min" or "max" parameter as the
    constraint of sentence length (number of characters).

    Both min and max values are required to be integers greater or equal to
    zero. The value of max should be greater then the value of min. If any
    of these values are invalidate, it is treated as if they are not passed.

    The default values of min, max are 0 and 140, respectively.

    The implementation random algorthm based, thus it needs indefinite time
    to generate the result. If it takes more then 1000 iterations, it aborts
    and return the results anyway, regardless the length constraint. This
    can happen when the lengths of phrases from corpus do no adds up to a
    value within the given range.

    The returned scalar is the generate sentence string of wide characters.
    (Which makes Encode::is_utf8 return true.)
